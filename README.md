# tic-tac-tournament

*Can you win at tic-tac-toe... with a program?*

This repository has all the code needed to run our old-fashioned AI
tournament... a faceoff between game-playing programs.

There are three parts to this:

- The core engine in `ttt.py`, which finds and executes the
  other parts as appropriate.
- An automatic test suite to check that your entry is working
  (though how well it does is another question).
- An example agent which makes a random valid move.

Let the games begin!
